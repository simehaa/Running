# Running

The Ingebrigtsen brothers are known for running high volumes around their threshold pace. In order to do this without injuries, they limit their paces. Supposedly, the training effect of the limited paces (as opposed to harder effort) is the roughly same, but the restitution time is shorter and the risk of injury is lower.

If rumours are true, the famous workouts 10 x 3 min is run at max 22 km/h and 5 x 6 min is run at max 21 km/h.

How does this translate to your fitness level? This program assumes proportionality, and uses your PR from either 3k, 5k or 10k along with Jakob's PR to calculate a factor to how much slower than Jakob you are. This factor is then multiplied with the max interval paces, so that you can adopt the same training philosophy.
